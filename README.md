## NADW
This is repository for matlab scripts to produce most of the figures in MacGilcrist et al. (2020) "Locations and mechanisms of ocean ventilation in the high-latitude North Atlantic in an eddy-permitting ocean model", _Journal of Climate_.  
These scripts are presented without comment, but with apologies for their lack of organization. Assistance with interpretation or reuse can be requested from the author.  
The data on which these figures were build was generated using a hindcast simulation of the NEMO model, along with the Ariane Lagrangian trajectory software. Further details in the paper.
